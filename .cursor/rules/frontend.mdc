### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable. [1]
- Always use Arco Design UI components for building interfaces; leverage the comprehensive component library with 60+ crafted components that you can use out of the box. [2]
- Use Arco Design's theme tokens and customization capabilities instead of direct CSS when possible. [3]
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleChange" for onChange. [1]
- Implement accessibility features on elements following Arco Design's accessibility guidelines. [4]
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible. [1]
- Utilize Arco Design's extensive design tokens for customization to maintain consistency with the design system. [2]
- For mobile applications, consider using Arco Design Mobile which offers 50+ easy-to-use components based on TypeScript with simple and restrained UI design. [4]
